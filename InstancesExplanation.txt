-in the first line there are (at least) 2 numbers: the first is the number of jobs and the second the number of machines (the 3rd is not necessary, it is the average number of machines per operation)

-Every row represents one job: the first number is the number of operations of that job, the second number (let's say k>=1) is the number of machines that can process the first operation; then according to k, there are k pairs of numbers (machine,processing time) that specify which are the machines and the processing times; then the data for the second operation and so on...


Example: Fisher and Thompson 6x6 instance, alternate name (mt06)

6   6   1   
6   1   3   1   1   1   3   1   2   6   1   4   7   1   6   3   1   5   6   
6   1   2   8   1   3   5   1   5   10  1   6   10  1   1   10  1   4   4   
6   1   3   5   1   4   4   1   6   8   1   1   9   1   2   1   1   5   7   
6   1   2   5   1   1   5   1   3   5   1   4   3   1   5   8   1   6   9   
6   1   3   9   1   2   3   1   5   5   1   6   4   1   1   3   1   4   1   
6   1   2   3   1   4   3   1   6   9   1   1   10  1   5   4   1   3   1   

first row = 6 jobs and 6 machines 1 machine per operation
second row: job 1 has 6 operations, the first operation can be processed by 1 machine that is machine 3 with processing time 1.

On the next block, every row represents the setup time between this operation of this job and every other operation of each job, including this same operation of this job.

For example, supose we have this 6x6 matrix of setup times, and supose we have only 3 jobs with 2 operation each:

4 4 4 1
2 2 2 2
3 3 3 3
1 2 3 4

The second row represents the setup time between 1st operation of job 1 and every other operation and job (operation 1 of job 1, operation 1 of job 2, operation 1 of job 3 and operation 1 of job 4)

The next 3 blocks are respectively: initial start constraints for each job, deadlines for each job and initial solution for the instance.
Initial solution is presented following this pattern: each line contains the machine id and instant of processing time for the job, sorted by (job, operation).
Not every instance have all those features, but it's presented always in that specific order.
